## FARMER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM USING PYTHON-FLASK AND MYSQL
The primary goal of developing the "Farm Management System Project" application is to assist farmers by providing comprehensive agricultural information on the platform. This web-based application facilitates the exchange of best-practice farming techniques among farmers. It aims to enhance farmers' productivity and profitability. The system allows farmers to sell their products online and purchase tools and seeds directly from sellers. Additionally, farmers can manage their profiles, including registration, editing, and deletion of data.

Through this platform, farmers can market their produce online, and buyers can purchase various agricultural goods. Buyers can send purchase requests via email to verify the quality of the agricultural products.
